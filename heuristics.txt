Heurustic for Sliding Tile puzzle:

For sliding tile puzzle I've defined the heuristic to be the total number of misplaced tiles in the puzzle.
This heuristic is admissible becuase the total number of moves to order the tiles correctly
is at least the number of misplaced tiles. The number of moves for a misplaced tile to get
into its position is at least once.

Heuristic for Vampires and Werewolves:

For Vampires and Werewolves I've defined the heuristic to be the total number of vampires and 
werewolves in the east side of the river which can be calculated as 6 - (total number of vampires and werewolves
in the west). This is an admissible heuristic because the total number of moves to get all the vampires and
werewolves in the west is at least the number of vampires and werewolves in the west.
